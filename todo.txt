- robust error implementation + stack trace
- semantic analysis



- function must have parameters, otherwise program crashes (fix this)
- function is able to update params outside of the func (fix this)
- if function returns but the caller doesnt use the result, the return is executed where the function was called (error)
- functions can be called with a differing number of parameters
